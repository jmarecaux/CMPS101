Notes:

I wrote the Lex.java file strongly based on the FILEIO.java on the website of Patrick Tantalo. I then wrote the
sorting algorithm based on the "insertion sort" we ran through in lecture.

List.java has been written by me
ListClient has been pulled from the website and unchanged
Makefile has been pulled and unedited from the website
