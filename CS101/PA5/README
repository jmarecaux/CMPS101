README 				- this
Makefile			- the makefile to compile FindComponents.c and GraphTest.c
List.c 				- the list implementation
List.h 				- header to list.c
Graph.h				- the header to graph.c
Graph.c 			- the graph implementation
GraphTest.c 		- test file for Graph, has been changed a lot over the time
					  but I have turned in the one from the website
FindComponents.c 	- the main script that reads an input file and prints the graph
					  and its SCC to the outfile.

I had help from Saeed Kargar in debugging my DFS. Other than that I have
put a lot of testing into this and everything is good.
